#This is the official list of things that I haven't done yet.


##These need to be done before starting on the angular app.
* Create words. Allow ONLY play.player=user AND (play.player=None).word exists.
* Verify that the playID is returned by the play creation
* Verify that the play's are listable (for that player)

##These need to be done at some point.
* Remove list view from playwords. Basically, it's "get" only.
* Authorize playwords based on play.player=user
* Verify fields on the play are properly initialized.
* figure out how to login. From angular app.
